# RagdollR6
R6 Ragdoll Module.

## About
I made this out of curiosity on how to make ragdoll with R6, this module was made 1+ year ago but never been used, that's why i decided to publish it here.

## Wally
```toml
RagdollR6 = "f4yking/ragdollr6@1.0.1"
```

Don't Forget to add this so Trove would work.
```toml
[place]
shared-packages = "game.ReplicatedStorage.Packages"
```
